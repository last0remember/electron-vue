## Overview

Fork from https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue, update Electron from 2.x to 11.x

### Getting Started

This boilerplate was built as a template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and includes options to customize your final scaffolded app. The use of `node@^7` or higher required. electron-vue also officially recommends the [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.org) package manager as it handles dependencies much better and can help reduce final build size with `yarn clean`.

```bash
# Install vue-cli and scaffold boilerplate
npm install -g vue-cli
vue init simulatedgreg/electron-vue my-project

# Install dependencies and run your app
cd my-project
yarn # or npm install
yarn run dev # or npm run dev
```
